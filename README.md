# 🚀 ZapDNS: Because Life's Too Short for Slow Internet!

## 🦸‍♂️ Features That'll Make You Go "Wow!" (or at least "Huh, Neat.")

- 🌈 Cross-platform: Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux. Because I believe in equal opportunity DNS management.
- ⚡ Lightning fast: Changes DNS faster than you can say "Why am I reinstalling Windows... again?"
- 🧙‍♂️ Easy to use: So simple, even your Windows-reinstalling-addicted friend could do it. (You know who you are.)
- 🎭 Multiple DNS options: Google, Cloudflare, or go rogue with custom DNS. Choose your DNS flavor like you choose your OS of the Iek!

## 🦄 Why ZapDNS?

- Because "OhNoNotAnotherWindowsInstallINeedToSetUpMyDNSAgain" was too long of a name.
- Born from the ashes of a humble batch script, like a DNS phoenix rising to cross-platform glory.
- It's free! (But I accept donations in the form of therapy sessions for chronic OS reinstallers)
- It's faster than remembering where that darn DNS setting is hidden in your freshly installed OS.
- Impress your friends with your ability to set up DNS faster than they can say "Why are you reinstalling Windows... again?"

## 🐛 Found a Bug?

First, make sure it's not just your OS glitching because you've reinstalled it for the 42nd time this month. If it's actually in my code, let me know! I'll add it to my "Wall of Shame" and fix it faster than you can say "Format C:".

## 📜 License

MIT License. Feel free to use it, abuse it, but please don't refuse it. You can even reinstall it as many times as you reinstall your OS. I won't judge.

## 🚀 Installation: Choose Your Adventure!

Option 1: For the "I clone everything" crowd
1. Clone this repo (yes, I'm still not picky)
2. Run `pnpm install` (Because we're not savages using npm, right?)
    - No pnpm? Fine, use `npm install` or `yarn add`. We don't judge. (Much.)
3. Zap away with `pnpm start`! (Or `npm start` if you're stuck in 2018)

Option 2: For the "I like my software like I like my OS: fresh and downloadable" people
1. Head to the releases page
2. Download the standalone executable (it's like Node.js and ZapDNS had a baby)
3. Run it and feel the ZAP!

Remember: No matter how often you refresh your Windows installation, ZapDNS will always be there for you, ready to set your DNS faster than you can say "Where did all my files go?"

May your internet be fast, and your DNS changes faster! 🚀✨
